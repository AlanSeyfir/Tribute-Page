                    <ul id="list-info">
                        <!-- <li>In 1833, Lovelace was introduced to Charles Babbage, also known as the "Father of Computers", by her tutor, Mary Somerville. Since then a professional friendship between the young woman and Babbage ensued, and Ada became interested in the latter's 'Difference Engine.
                        </li>
                        <li>She also became engrossed in phrenology, which dealt with measuring the human skull, and animal magnetism.
                        </li>
                        <li>In the year 1840, Babbage's lecture on his invention, the 'Analytical Engine', delivered at the 'University of Turin', was written in French by Italian, Luigi Menabrea. This paper was printed two years later, in the 'Bibliothèque universelle de Genève'.
                        </li>
                        <li>After the publication, Lovelace took it upon herself to translate Luigi's French paper into English, after a request from Babbage's acquaintance, Charles Wheatstone. The paper was transcribed during 1842-43, and as an addition, the young lady included notes of her own analysis.
                        </li>
                        <li>Her notes spoke about how the 'Analytical Engine' was more advanced than previous machines that were built for the purpose of calculations. She claimed that Babbage's machine could do more than just numerical computations, and went on to explain its operations in detail.
                        </li>
                        <li>In her notes, which have been marked from A to G, the last contains an algorithm to make Babbage's machine calculate 'Bernoulli numbers'. For writing the first ever algorithm, Ada is hailed as the pioneer of computer programming.
                        </li>
                        <li>During this time, Ada also explained the shortcomings in the 'Analytical Engine', and is now considered as a predecessor of debuggers.
                        </li>
                        <li>In 1844, she ventured on to design a model that would use mathematics to decode the neurological process involved behind the evolution of feelings, calling this "a calculus of the nervous system".
                        </li>
                        -->
                        <li>Her inspiration came from the fact that her mother always suggested that Ada was probably insane. She met Andrew Crosse, an engineer, in order to find out how she could use electrical experimentation to devise her model. Her plan wasn't successful, and the model never saw the light of the day.
                        </li>
                        <li>In 1844, Lovelace also went on to review a research publication on Animal Magnetism, written by Baron Karl von Reichenbach, but her work was never published.
                        </li>
